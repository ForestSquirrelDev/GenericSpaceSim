# Generic Space Sim
Idea of the project was to challenge myself and see if I can mimic Unity engine's physics by using only Transform.

To download the project you can either clone the repository or download one of unitypackages:
- [Original project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jVkF2nSzNzuTofgM8kjBztXfi9Psl_Lg/view?usp=sharing) with heavy skybox and spaceship assets (316MB in total).
- [Lightweight project](https://github.com/ForestSquirrelDev/GenericSpaceSim/blob/master/Packages/Generic%20space%20sim%20demo%20light%20size.unitypackage) with smaller size assets (44MB in total).
