Idea of the project was to see if i can mimic movement type that is normally achieved by rigidbody physics, using only object's transform. I did not know what i'm gonna achieve in the end, but i think it turned out to be pretty fun and arcade-like movement system. All visuals are free assets from Unity assetstore.
